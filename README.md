#Shoppr 0.1

##Overview
First things first, this is an app with a bad name. If you or anyone you know can think of a better one, please refer them (along with any other questions or input) to alexanderbglover@gmail.com.

Glad that's out of the way.

The purpose of this app is to help all of the organized meal-prep-folk of the world to create a shopping list based on what meals they've chosen for a particular week. Over time, a user will have a database of recipes that they've entered. They then will be able to select however many recipes they'd like (or create new recipes), and a shopping list for that week will auto-generate.

##instructions
Enjoy.

##The Future
Some updates I'd like to implement:
 - Users will be able to select a category of food for all of their ingredients (dairy, produce, protein, etc...). Ingredients are already created as objects so this won't be too difficult on my end, it's just a matter of making it easy for the user.
 -  Weekly list will generate with the option to list by category. This would improve the shopping experience quite a bit.
 - Home page will display the user's favorites (most used recipes), as well as some recipes that haven't been made in a while.
 - Would like to get this up as a heroku app or something fairly soon.

##Installation
You shouldn't need anything other than the latest version of Ruby and Bundler in order to get started.

To run this app locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/gloverab/sinatra-project-shoppr
```
Then run a ```bundle install```
